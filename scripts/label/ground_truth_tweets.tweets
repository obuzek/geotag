@DrNaif the main underlying issue is about who decides what's right. I believe that unless you are harming others, no one should interfere
@DrNaif the issue is that we sometime use a definition for freedom that isn't consistent and is based on a specific cultural context
@DrNaif I adore freedom. I just don't like arbitrary lines. As long as the lines are consistent and based on the same logic then it's ok
@DrNaif I don't think that's a good classification. Some people have an inclination to be addicted to alcohol (or sugar for that matter)
@DrNaif weed isn't internationally banned. Also, many would argue that the main reason behind drug violence is their ban. Should we left it?

“@BigJuicyPen: Loving you was my favorite mistake.”
People always say to stand up when you fall, so why don't they come and stand in my shoe feel all my heartaches and stand up for me to see.
Toughest part in life is when you only can see but cannot get.
“@ZENSHIROHIDEAKI: Don't be close to me if you want to talk gossip, behind my back. Be very far away. So you'll have no rights”
The greatest thing in life is finding someone who knows all your mistakes and differences and still finds you absolutely amazing
The worst feeling is when someone makes you feel special, then suddenly leaves you hanging & you have to act like you don’t care at all.
We met, we talked, we flirted, I fell for you, I trusted you...and then you flirted with her & ruined everything. Thanks dickhead.
@shanagaffar loooool we do rent her at night after 12. ... But novstealing. ... I cant part those filledup cheecks of her loool

If a #Taurus likes you, you'd probably never guess it cause they don't show it.

When she is acting like she doesn't care about u anymore, that's when she needs you the most.
If U find a good woman that's pretty, intelligent, and appreciative..........u should wife her up...
Well maybe some people are meant to fall in love with each other, but not meant to be together.. thats life
Single &gt; Arguing Relationship
Life isn't a CD, so don't be a player.
Intoxicated by memories and feelings
Life is short. Break the rules, forgive quickly, laugh uncontrollably, and never regret anything that made you smile. :D

Real friends don't get offended when you call them bitch, hoe or slut. They smile and call you something more offensive.

Ignoring the house phone because you know its not for you.
When I was little, I used to sing in the shower. Now? I make life decisions in there.
If a guy isn't trying his best to have you, then, probably, he isn't the best for you.
"I trust you” is better than “i love you” because you may not always trust the person you love but you can always love the person you trust.

The doc says "no throat inflamed. No fever. You just Lost your voice."
I miss u but sometimes I want to keep it that way. It's my "love-hate" feelings towards u. Just mine.
Sometimes I really wonder if you just wanna say hi or do you have something to say to me.
I was told indirectly that my Bravefront was the reason things don't work out. Hours later, I still can't accept it.
I cld have, but I didn't. I shld have, but I didn't. I ought to have, but I never. All these spells regret and remorse.
I was never well-known for my determination
Seems like it all end today.
@loveandfight44 lol to be honest Idk wads the title of my song of the week
@loveandfight44 my song of the week
@loveandfight44 hahaha cos it's from hampers and my mgmt gave all bird nest to me. They only take the wine n abalone
My mood is greatly affected.....
My duty starts at 4. It's only 3:22 and he's asking where I am.
One should take the MRT in the morning to see how many foreigners we have. The smell, the noise, the accents & the fashion.
@fatspooney you're scaring me.
@fatspooney if there's one thing you would have prepared for before going to aerospace eng, what would it be?
@hahsaka too bad my computer can't support it.
I seriously think that e paranormal activity 3 in Singapore is not the full version. YouTube for paranormal activity 3 trailer 2 to see why.
@himynameisgerm you must be joking to take my joke seriously....
@himynameisgerm ya... It's funny they don't have all those stuff. After all, ain't everything made from where they came from?
not again... “@SCDF: Body found in bedok reservoir today morning. @SCDF paramedics at scene. http://t.co/PaRVVCf8”
I've nothing against PRC asking me for way in MRT. In fact I don't hate them. But they really need some listerine.
@asyrafisnin hahaha. Cold weather I guess? 2 stroke always damn hard to start.
@asyrafisnin Wah. Must be freaking shiok to ride into their school right. All the best man. Should be no kick for you.
@himynameisgerm where got time for all these. National service is the new fun.
@norrahss no need to study is it. I bet you're feeling hungry.
@norrahss I never say prefer who. I just say she damn sad.
@norrahss so saddening for the lawyer la. Btw I'm so proud my sister's studying TCM now under NTU. :)
@norrahss ya nice right. Watching now?
This Chinese 9pm show on channel 8 is actually quite nice. If not for the advertisements, I would have followed the series.
The only difference between the PTI he wanted and a clown is the red nose.
Whoa. Twitter flooded with 11:11 11/11/11. Really don't know what's so exciting about it. Someone enlighten me please.
After a long tiring two days work in NS, a provost made my day just by greeting me as a PTI even when I was wearing a civilian attire. :)
@sayheyjude @partyygnome @zhou_xuanyi oh is it. I don't know man. I'm clueless about my course. Haha. Thanks!
@sayheyjude @partyygnome @zhou_xuanyi aerospace engine. A lot of PRC! Haha.
If you're going to watch immortals this weekend, I suggest you read up on Greek mythology first. It's super confusing.
@norrahss just now I thought he's going to poke the dr guan you know. Don't know how many times he want to poke people. Lol.
@norrahss shit it's getting too nice.
@hahsaka @asyrafisnin how you two know each other!! Lol.
@wafersgang how to be astronaut in Singapore?! Lol.
@wafersgang I don't know how to reply this! Lol.
@xcheesepie dude I'm going to stop following you cos you're spamming me.
@asyrafisnin omg! Lucky you go thru defensive riding. Take care man. Ride safe.
@xcheesepie @ziquanaw now you know.
@ziquanaw @xcheesepie lol you also kana. Hahaha.

Can't believe HBO's going to show paranormal activity 2 next!!!!! Sleepless night today.
@asyrafisnin Aaaaarrrrrrrgggggghhhhh! Nvm you got sp I got bmx.
Train service will operate overnight at 15mins interval after midnight!!! Cool or what.
Whatsap is free!!!  fml
@Zhou_Xuanyi maybe one day we should all report sick together. Let them know the feeling of having no condom. Haha.
@enhao91 best part is when he's getting fucked for not getting the job done, he'll come begging for your help as if he'd never charged you.
@enhao91 in the rare occasion that you screw up in doing his job, he'd charge you and forget about all the good you've done.
Being in NS is like being a condom. The regulars will make use of you to keep his own rice bowl but throw you aside once he's done.
@JackHimself14 holy shit. Sick stuff. 1 minute 1 dollar. Reminds me of IN TIME.
@norrahss @yxlim89 @pohsin91 @reginamoh @_siyi_ haha. I miss that cheap cai fun. Ridiculously cheap. Add rice also free. Argh, hungry...
@yxlim89 @pohsin91 @norrahss @reginamoh @_siyi_ sharron not same date as us lo. We suffered longer!
@JackHimself14 last episode of walking dead. Barn full of walkers. OMG.
@eroztic @sayheyjude by saying you will get 8 pac. Haha.
Wah shiok my fav song's playing now at 313.
@norrahss then your Facebook album should be called HOW WE GET FAT. hahaha.
@JingWeiL got. Look properly.
@JingWeiL @ziquanaw don't bring plastic bag! You won't know what you can find in there...
Zzz. Want to eat McDonald's but still got 10 mins to the lunch value meal. Waiting like a dog.
@ziquanaw @jingweil future fellow NTU students. Got lobang share leh. I also going to ORD in a few weeks time.
@asyrafisnin congrats lawyer! Now give me your SP!! Hahaha.
I swear the MRT used all the profit from the raised fare to upgrade their air-con. It's so damn cold...
@PohSin91 she never die la. The guy got blinded.
@PohSin91 grandpa kept it in his coat and he showed it once to me
@wafersgang wonder who...
@asyrafisnin oh FML. It's o level... Nvm pretend you never see my previous reply.
@JackHimself14 one episode only
Freaking hell. Don't understand why they want to be in the pool to chit chat. Get out so I can swim! Lifeguarding people chatting is stupid.
@Jasmintan @deafkneewong I can play. Virtual one. Put an iPhone there then FaceTime.
@Lionel_Lim yeah. It's 3pm in sg now. Don't be a lazy arse like the British.
So many good things to tweet about. Fuck that.
@Jasmintan heh. Solid ah. So small size but cc so big! Well done you.
@sothebimbosays well, fun fun fun helps me realize how things are not when I get back.
@sothebimbosays I know. I'm just going through a period that's not so nice, and I had to share. Sorry!
@sothebimbosays hey love. My quote goes this way, everything's going to be alright. If it isn't, end it.
Sometimes I wonder why I try. It's not even important and my effort is not met. Time to stop wasting these unnecessary effort.
@PearlPur @PearlPur I cannot see my dear friend here make a mistake and not help her! What if she meets her idol then say it? So malu!
@Jasmintan "might as well" what is "must well"?!
@Jasmintan @deafkneewong oh wait. It's almost 9am in SG. My bad!
@Jasmintan @deafkneewong why you not sleeping yet!
@alexciapeterson the hotel is right smack in leidseplain where everything is. Coffeeshop, bars, clubs, pub crawls, casino. It's all there.
@alexciapeterson depends on what you want to do, but if you can, stay at the Marriott. That's where I stay, the hotel is awesome.
@alexciapeterson haha. Missed me by a month!
I cannot blame you for what you do not know. But I sure as hell can and will be pissed.
@Jasmintan @deafkneewong it's in Paris! How can it be French made if its in sg! 😲
@deafkneewong @jasmintan you should go and see the one at Champs Elyseé. The French made LV are made above the retail area.
@xinwei92 damnit. I still have to be here for another exam. Looking through the graduates list makes me sad.
@eatmeimfat who ask you to buy bb!
I don't know 7 out of 10 songs Poptart is playing at Velvet. Guess I'm too old for this. #VelvetUnderground #POPTART
People only like keys that opens every lock and not locks that can be opened by every key.
@eugenecsw crowded max. It's horrible w all the shoppers on the ground floor when I went.
@Jasmintan don't angst. Children like to drop things. Especially the expensive things.
@eugenecsw yup. Opposite LV, along George V Café
Do not do unto others, what you do not wish for others to do unto you.
@eatmeimfat my twitter location thing very off. Don't want! You were supposed to come meet me! :(
@eatmeimfat @alvinaling @cherieboomboom @kevingacad @lohyanyi eh. I hate you. You didn't even call until you left Clarke quay!
@Jasmintan treat you nice so that when she needs cheap or casual labor can call you ma! Don't fall for it!
@eatmeimfat you just did it last weekend! Oh well I'll see you soon enough. I probably see you less times in a year than I have fingers.
@eatmeimfat meh. I know. You always use when we were supposed to meet then you change plans!
An excuse is the skin of a reason stuffed with a lie.
@Cutepetz take it easy. Oftentimes things can happen too quickly in a moment of anger, frustration and despair.
@leathershorts yup. I'm watching for the men's fashion.
@leathershorts heh. I was wondering what snoop dogg and dre were doing on the red carpet.
@Jasmintan maybe she try to put coco in the microwave.
@Jasmintan what she do?
@AdelaideNg for one night it'll do. But I believe they nap on that everyday?
@NanGoh @noonegold @nina_des @_justinsilas last week you were at zouk also meh
@AdelaideNg that can't be good for their backs.

@sothebimbosays no? This twitter location always shows Malaysia! Your legs look like chopsticks pls!
@sothebimbosays why you so skinny!
If we all understood each other. Everything would be so much simpler.

@sothebimbosays what's wrong?
@deafkneewong Nabei. Goodnight do many people nv goodnight the one who sent you home!
I'm sorry I let go. But it's only for the best. If I can not give you happiness, I will not stay to make you miserable either.
It's for the best.
How classy. Spending the night in somebody's hotel room. Mmm.
@xinwei92 hahaha! Oh well. Make new friends!
@Jasmintan Haha! It's ok la. I should be awake anyway. Snoozing since 8.
Woke up because of flood of fb notifications when @Jasmintan tagged 12 photos of me at one go. *yawn.

Feeling no love and feeling stressed like hell.

Misunderstood, misunderstood.
Good intending gestures never read as good.

Putting ur child to bed late hoping he'd wake up later in the am, does NOT work! They become overtired & can't sleep well. #momadvice
It's funny how kids do everything u ask when they really want something! Take advantage moms!!! #momadvice
Take advantage of every second u spend with ur child; u never know wht life has in store for u tht u may not see them anymore #momadvice
@YouserW lol I believe u shud start pottytrainin when child cn somewhat understand,say bout 2 years.But each child is different. #momadvice
Don't underestimate the power of ur toddler's intelligence; they see, hear and imitate everything you do or say. #momadvice
@YouserW lol which one r u referring to?
@MamiHassan If he cries from hunger constantly I'd say eat foods tht increases ur supply or supplement.Dont do it if u or baby don't need 2.
@MamiHassan He's still young! Any extra day of breast milk is best 4 ur baby. Dont believe the hype & go with ur instinct. I say u go girl!
@MamiHassan But I'm curious to know why they tellin u to switch to formula??
@MamiHassan Whaaa?! Stay on Breast feeding as long as u & baby r happy; it's nature's best! Unless he's like 3+ I wouldn't recommend it!
Don't over think potty training & don't force it upon ur child; you won't see your 18 year old running around In diapers. #momadvice
Cut your babies nails every 2-3 days.. these things grow fast and you don't want your baby looking like he's been attacked! #momadvice
Thumb sucking or pacifier? I say thumb sucking - they won't lose it in their sleep! Either way they need to soothe themselves. #momadvice
Sometimes no matter how u sleep train ur baby,it doesn't always work.Babies have a mind of their own & will do wht pleases them. #momadvice
Any questions or need a second opinion? Feel free to ask! NOTE; Only experienced in 3 yr olds and below :) #momadvice
@MamiHassan Negative talks that u don't give him formula or that you should?
I don't personally believe in branded diaper creams; good ol' Vaseline works 100 times better and is best for your baby's skin. #momadvice
Having a baby does NOT mean u have to look like you've been run over by a truck; invest in some makeup, perfume and a smile :) #momadvice
Love & treat your children equally. There's nothin more hurtful than seeing your child constantly fight for your attention. #momadvice
Havin a baby shouldn't end ur 'social' life. If friends won't accept ur new life they're not ur friends in the first place. #momadvice
I don't claim I know it all, but I speak from personal experience of raising 2 babies. Take it or leave it, just don't judge me. #momadvice
Breast feeding over bottle anyday! However supplementing or feeding with bottle 100% of the time does not make u a "bad" mom. #momadvice
Don't follow the book, follow ur instincts when raising a baby. You know best how to raise ur baby. #momadvice
If you're gonna hv a busy day or weekend ahead without your child, spend some extra quality time with them the day/s before. #momadvice
If u believe havin a child was difficult n don't wanna do it a 2nd time round, re-think it, it actually gets easier! Trust me :) #momadvice
Don't jus have one child! If you're gon hv one have at least another. Think of ur child being lonely before thinking of urself. #momadvice
Bathe baby 15 mins after being fed. That way they won't b cranky during a bath. They somewhat get really hungry during one! #momadvice
Handle babies gently. A little bobbing & rocking should be fine,they won't break. Babies r stronger than we perceive them to be. #momadvice
Never let anyone tell you ur not doin a good job as a mom. Do the best you can and baby will love u more than anyone u know. #momadvice

@almuraisy how much did bing change over the last year vs Google ? Slow isn't  absolute brother :).
@almuraisy 7. b. Samsung planning WP7 is a win where WP7 and Android were head to head. Others will follow...
@almuraisy 7. a. 40,000 Isn't an announced number. I live in the states and I can tell you that WP7 devices consistently run out of stock!!!
@almuraisy and remember what you said, creative is better... Who's more creative, bing or Google?
@almuraisy 3. tell me one dev tools that us ahead if Microsoft by any means !!!
@almuraisy in short: Microsoft is thousands of businesses that live on its techs. Billions of everyday users around the globe.
@almuraisy 7. Windows Phone 7 drove Samsung to plan 63% of 2011 phones to be WP7, and mr. Android far behind.
@almuraisy 6. Bing algo and ads now serve to more than 35% of the web users. If you don't know that's millions of people.
@almuraisy 5. XBox and kinect won the gaming war with competition far behind.
@almuraisy 4. SQL Server security proves that Iracle is far behind.
@almuraisy 3. Whoever tries Microsoft development tools knows the difference, knows who's better (obviously you didn't)
@almuraisy 1. Windows is way better than any competitors. Numbers and customer satisfaction prove this.
Passed a week with # WP7 and loving it ^_^. Very slick indeed!!! Goodbye  iPhone, for good...

No offence, but what the hell is wrong with people here in Kiev!?
The way these ppl treat each other on a subway, shows that our nation has very little hope.
drunk but not with wine
I must also say that automatic transmission drives me nuts! Oh why the hell it keeps changing my gears?!
Seriously, Id rather walk than drive keeping constant lookout for that consumption gauge!
Driving slowly as an attempt to cut down on my petrol expenses really gets on my nerves. Fuck that!
wanna share some love with @Irinalala http://t.co/O5jjQX4f
i did not know how she knew that i drove for 12 hours. And again i said no, and asked why,
Simon was such a lovely lady. She,kindly, offered a 10 minutes massage. . Said No. She wanted to give me a half an hour massage,
He just cannot stop asking me about them. WHY CANNOT HE STOP ASKING ?
What an amazing experience. http://t.co/AfjdLBa6
and started to swear. And i told her, im not gonna do anything not because u r not pretty, but because you are a dirty whore.
She said she would give everything a girl cannot give to her lover, again said no. She realized i would not do anything with her. Continue.
A whore offered her services, but i refused. Then she gave me a 50% discount, and stared to think for a moment. And then said "No". Continue

Top 5lies.. 1. I'm fine. 2. That was my last piece of gum. 3. I'll call you back. 4. I'm on my way. 5. I never got that text.
that awkward moment, when you hear everyone turn the page of their test, and your still on the first question.
Don't look for love, let love find you. That's why it's called falling in love, you don't force yourself to fall, you just do.
Never let anyone break your dream. Never stop dreaming. There's nothing impossible. It's impossible as long as your thinking it's impossible
The worst feeling is pretending you don't care about something, when really it's all you seem to think about.
Hurting someone with the truth is better than killing them with a lie.
Sometimes you have to forget what you feel and remember what you deserve.
I'm worried, I'm stressed, I'm confused, but I know that God will make the right things happen so it will all be ok.
I always wonder if someone in the world is doing exactly the same as me.
Im a teenager.I have a messy room.I spend most of my time online.I have private things on my phone.I go to bed late& Im crazy about 1 person
Never apologize for saying what you feel because that’s like saying; sorry for being real. That's the truth

True love can blind you but at the same time if you let it, it can also open your eyes.
Lucky is the man who is the first love of a woman, but luckier is the woman who is the last love of a man.  - Unknown
To us, family means putting your arms around each other and being there.  ~Barbara Bush  
Great passions, my dear, don't exist: they're liars fantasies. What do exist are little loves that may last for a short or a longer while.
Men always want to be a woman's first love. Women have a more subtle instinct: What they like is to be a man's last romance. --Oscar Wilde

So seductive ... Felt like I was in the candy shop....
Talk about anything under the sun.. I was tempted but I ran home anyways ..I couldn't look at her
FML I m down with a bad cold again... How do I get to work
@WeiyiChen the proportion though .. Like how much vinegar to the rice
@lackadaisygirl tin tin... Have u catch it yet
@WeiyiChen omg!!! Teach me!!) I tried n I didn't think it taste good
@lackadaisygirl i think so too but the movie tickets has been bought
@WeiyiChen u are on a diet ... Not bored
So should I still go for the movie tonight ... Dont want to cough in your face
I can't recall that there is any month that I m not down with a cold
It's not the car nor the money ...
@lackadaisygirl lol it's just sad that my expectation on a bf is just to find a decent normal guy .., like basically it is that
@lackadaisygirl yea please... I have another deadline again ...
@lackadaisygirl she went on n on for 10 mins abt it cos she watched a documentary abt that recently... Anyways congratulations again!!!
@ElaineJieying thanks babe! Meet up soon...
Don't treat someone else with the baggage from ur past r/s.It's unfair.Ever stop to think why women just walk away from u suddenly
Maybe she is a pearl but u with ur bitterness turn her into rocks ..
Sighz my sis said a series of stuffs that I should be careful abt my date such as he might kidnap me n trade me into prostitution ...
It doesn't work for me because I m worldly ... In other words, not a Shen jin bing who thinks too much..
I really don't care if there is peace or no peace in your heart when u are pursuing a girl ..so much for a spiritual wife
@ElaineJieying it's ok.. It might not even work out ... So let's not get excited for me. But let's catch up anyways ..
Maybe I m doing too much
There is nothing wrong with the number of cells I have ... If I plate 0.4 million cells per well n I get 0.3+ million in the end after wash
She chut pattern again..annoying to the max.. Yea knows it all but I don't give a Damm.. Why do u care how much cells I m acquiring
@twistedfairie oh dear... Take care of yourself
@ElaineJieying this Sunday is packed ... Best time will be sat evenings ... Can chill
Been thru the suicidal guy,the flirts, morons n idiots ... Too tired now to hope for more
Insecurities. They are like poison. Clear your mind. Be positive
@lackadaisygirl don't put on much make up.. Gonna do it for u.. We can even do it before the Ktv
He volunteers his face for my make up practice... :D now I have to make your eyes look bigger
Ur bitterness and anger towards her/women just put me off... Look at yourself before u judge others
I might get drunk in the office before I meet my date ... Uh oh
@twistedfairie are u ok though? Why are u vomiting
Need I to say more ... U have no substance , no class no depth . In addition u have bad breath .. Just being honest...
It was fun painting his face
It gets more suspicious each time he "like"s a comment or comment on my status... Dude.. U gotta grow up
Who came up with this idea ? But I m sure someone will be very interested n concerned about this. http://t.co/U0X6EI0N”
Bad experiences let u learn... Yet they also left you a trail of insecurities n fear that history may repeat itself .But I gotta be brave
I m scared yet excited ...
U aren't into me ... I think ...
Talk to me to find out more about me.. Don't investigate
U should get the hint now ... I don't show my make up less face to my guy friends.. To see it .., u need to progress this
I told him that I will return him the favor for sending me home by doing facial for him ... There was a long laugh of reluctance..
I just need to be assured
@ElaineJieying right I will try an hr non stop ... 60 x 26 = 150 ish cal
@GGLENNDA give me alis one too... We will hold a whatsapp conference
@lackadaisygirl u are flying to Italy today? Niceeeee
It's official
My cooking skills will be assessed by me fussy on Saturday :(
The awkward moment - bringing your newly attached bf to a lingerie shop because there is a sale
@ElaineJieying which club
@ElaineJieying Friday night ... Hahaha okie
@ElaineJieying u want to go tonight
@ElaineJieying he is at a wedding dinner ...
@ElaineJieying are u at home now
I actually miss clubbing ... Hhah
Took a zoom in picture of my bf's armpit hair ... It's so long ... Why u no want to trim
@GGLENNDA yes ... U can see me in sg ... I m going Tokyo on 9 feb to 15 feb.. When r u here
Then it makes me think of the mice I mated
I totally did not feel anything when I see him putting his arm around her waist.. It's good now .. But yes can sense that u r avoiding me
@ElaineJieying yea ... Except that I m stressed out at work.. Freaking deadline
@ElaineJieying flying off on 9 feb then back on 15 .. Maybe next week if not after 15 ... Sorry .. Been very busy .. I have no time to shop
@ElaineJieying hey good... But very very busy .. Been working on weekends n till 9 or 10 these days ... I hope next week but I m flying off
I m so bored with work that I m going to stalk rain n his six packs ...if only I get to do photo editing on six packs
@wongkeanwah I shall bring u along on my Facebook
Tokyo Tokyo Tokyo in less than a weeks time ..
@lackadaisygirl I m like taking a deep breath before I start ... I m so dreading it ...
Last two patients n I can close this 1.5 months of ordeal
@GGLENNDA hey Glenda !!! Hope u are well ... Is ur mom ok now.. Sorry been busy working. I m free to meet up now until Thurs when I fly off
I m kinda amuse how ppl are unusually concern over one status update of mine n thinking that I m complaining abt my r/s
Dearie, If he says u are the one .. Then he shouldn't look at someone else .. He shouldn't confuse u at all!
Sometimes it's useless to worry soooo much ... Having faith n focus on the bigger things .. U magnify the positive ..
@ElaineJieying is this to someone I know too
If that person is no longer your friend , why bother to keep him or her on ur fb
People love to throw u into tests all the time ... U can choose not to conform to it

I just paid my first fawry invoice. Not bad, huge latency though.
@gammal @ehabelbadry yah I think they should ask for investment priority after removal but mines are buried under tons of sand after 65yrs.
@ehabelbadry this un report claims removal could reach 1000$ per mine www.unicef.org/graca/mines.htm
@ehabelbadry no, afaik, 1 mine =100$ and we have around 15million mine, so total cost of 1.5 billion $
@ehabelbadry how u got this number? One mine costs around 100$ to demine.
@gammal @hammady not sure how they implement it, I heard it through a non technical person.
@hammady @gammal just make an active VPN connection to your server and everything routed through it.
@hammady @gammal it seems a problem with the billing system of stc, check here http://t.co/PPYWpeM

We all want to stay in Malaysia but is there ANY opportunity here? Think about it!
@joshuachieng haha (: No la.. Why are you on twitter? Go enjoy Jakarta la!
@NgWengMING Who says I am not one too! =D
OMG! I just listened to a SMART Tunnel commercial on radio! Is it really necessary?
Taylor's Gym is good! Except for the green coloured pool that they promise to clean by tomorrow!
My name is not Lim B.
How about I go to sleep now and dream (=
Interracial marriage the solution for Malaysia? (:
My life in the hands of this thing! @limamyyensu @Marcuse_94 http://t.co/wI5mUTpG
Parking extention at Taylor's... So far! http://t.co/HopMDMQp

Why am I falling for someone?? I shouldn't be right? Anyway, I'm hungry.. (:
@CrystalTheGun LOL.. Was at Fitness First! Heading home already! Haha.. Eh, foursquare a lil scary hor!! XD
I just dropped my laptop off the boat....It's a Dell, rolling in the deep.
Admit it, you should be doing something else really important right now but came on Twitter instead.
If people could read my mind, I'd get punched in the face a lot.
Instead of "lol" try "lsimhbiwfefmtalol." Laughing silently in my head because it wasn't funny enough for me to actually laugh out loud.
3 words 8 letters, that lead to instant popularity- "I HAVE GUM!"
"Coke Please!" "Is Pepsi alright?" "Is Monopoly money alright?!"
When life is sweet, say thank you & celebrate & when life is bitter, say thank you & grow.
Girl: "Your phone is ringing."  You: "Yeah, phones do that."
"Are You Single?" "No, I'm Plural." "No, I mean, are you free this friday?" "No, I'm expensive!"
Cops never say "Thank you for committing a crime and keeping us employed," selfish bastards!
Hey Sexy, Close the door behind you, drop your pants, get on top of me & satisfy your needs. Sincerely, The toilet.
Why are there never any good side effects? Just once, I'd like to read a medication bottle and see, "May cause extreme sexiness".
Remember when you see a teacher outside of school and you think to yourself: "They have lives?!"
Everything is funnier when you're not allowed to laugh.
So my friend David lost his ID, and now we just call him Dave.
It is really hard to establish confection of the new ironic love disasters
My alarm clock is clearly jealous of the relationship I have with my bed.
I think Lady Gaga just puts glue on herself and rolls around in random items.
In every circle of friends there's always that one person everyone secretly hates. Don't have one? Then it's probably you.
They say: you don't know what you've got until it's gone. Truth: You knew exactly what you had, you just never thought you'd lose it.
There are three kinds of people: Those who can count and those who can't.
Naming your iPod "The Titanic".. so it says "The Titanic is syncing."
Operator: "9-1-1 please hold."... Me: "Ok. Hey, stop stabbing me for a second"... Murderer: "Ok"
I'm pretty sure the guy who put the "r" in February also came up with the spelling for Wednesday.

@jzfizz when are you enlisting and what time
@visakanv @bongjklop u sure ? There's actually a funeral that's gonna happen. Cck
@maellability you can purchase them at any regular ticketing machines at the stations. Take note that passes differ between train companies.
@maellability just do a sum at the start of each day to see if the pass is worthed it. If you're taking 3 rides or more, go for the pass.
@maellability anyway not to worry! On days when you're traveling a lot, they've got 1day passes for unlimited rides. Saves mad loads
@maellability JR pass only worth if you're packing packing across different prefectures of Japan for at least 2 weeks.
X-ray of my sister's surgery. See the metal rods? It's amazing how they do it through key-hole surgery. http://t.co/bE45GhFp
@maellability that's okay. Be prepared that transport would be the most costly thing on a daily basis.
Another year, another #LanewaySG  Festival done. I don't even look like that picture anymore! http://t.co/R7IMizDs

Last song for The Drums! #LanewaySG http://t.co/KiNwJzmX
@lemonshortcake AWESOME. buy it.
@maellability @aloysiuslim has it.
@maellability  tip! If sign language/English fails, write Chinese on a paper. The Japanese read/write in most Chinese characters.
LANEWAY FESTIVAL on tomorrow. Time to dust off my camera.
My sister is heading back into the Intensive Care Unit .... Fluid in lungs. :(
@edwinwaliman in that case they'll need an over head platform expressway for gear 10 people like me so I won't plough through the elderly.

No stock. So ditched the SSD idea. The 7200 rpm one is not desirable - more heat is produced. Stucked with the 5400 one now. Blast!
As I have sworn: I achieved my First Platinum Trophy for PSN!   Jedd was of Great Help!

Growing up, I've always learnt to fight. But I don't wage war unessasarily, I fight for what's right & the right reasons.
Play with fire? You're gonna get burnt, worst is of you've played with the wrong fire
& in 81 days, I'll share the same venue & the same party for my blissful 24th birthday celebration. Extravaganza...here we come!
In 80 days, the biggest spectacle of an event will happen right here in Singapore Expo.
Thinking about those memories...only one word describes this, she's a fallen angel. No other words to describe
To my recently passed geng, Mak (Yenny), will always have you in my heart...I'll be missing you
& never will I forget you made sure everyone learns the correct things though it's through the hard way.
Have always admired your strength, courage & perserverance, which had given you the will to fight that battle you've been fighting.
Hoping that 1 day I could gather all my 'Best In The World' kakis for dinner! Luckily I don't have a whole football team worth of them!
What goes around, comes around. Simple fact of life. Think you might escape now, sooner or later it'll catch up on you. Just watch.
If some can do it, so can I. *Ding Ding Ding* The bell has rung. It's time.
I don't even wanna do this but you triggered me.
@Jeezcake Text me when it comes to these things for goodness sake
What a cold morning to start the day...

Fucking recruits, pumped the fuck out of you for pissing me off!
Screw the media seriously

Lost my card holder in camp. Uber Shagged...
Dying of tiredness...
Forsee myself of having panda-eyes soon
Fucking bunch of motherfuckers won't wanna move inside the bus. Fuck you all seriously
So much of being listed as a world-class public transport given the current situation now is fucked up.
Super-shagged
Spoilt of choices of what to eat
Blasting K-ON! soundtracks on the phone, uniform with slippers, walking around the camp like a boss.
I miss you idiot. Stop ignoring me.
LOL Daniel aka AiYo* under NSTI AS a recruit. Itchy of pumping the shit out of him soon!
My empty wallet is like a onion, when I open it, it makes me cry because I'm broke.

Greatest words to hear from your Master Corporal: "Get out of here. Go home dickwad."
This has got me prepared to do things I normally wouldnt, so thank YOU, and keep things moving the way they are :)
Where I see this going, the resulting words are dangerous, but it'll be good to say them and potentially mean it.
Well, in my mind, I'm beyond falling. This really was the one to catch me off guard, and teach me that a feeling like this was/is possible.
Another day in the books, goodnight world.
Kickin back on a lazy Saturday night.
Ppl need to learn how to tell when its time to get the fuck out of your room....
I'm officially saying that this will go further. But not now. Soon. I'm purposely going slow, don't worry, I can see the future ;)
You've got no clue how much the random conversations make my nights, and how much that one word you use makes my day.
Normally, this would get rushed, but hey, let's take the long way, ride this out.
Here we go again...this is all too familiar, I've definitely been here before, but not with this accomplice.
Dresses is a quick way to make you look sophisticated and  fabulous ! Remember to choose body hugging ones!
@Rave_Clairvon I was trying some plug ins. Anyway, it's linked to fb updates too

@Rave_Clairvon ok thanks!
Designing dresses is just #awesome. Our style: #sophistication #glamour #elegance http://t.co/PVRrq3X2

My twitter account is funny.some of them which whom I follow and follow me seem to be missing.
One of the facebook seller actually send me the dress twice which I find such a waste because it's the same colour same design.

Work is my therapy.
Seems like another good opportunity is waiting for my acceptance. If yes, this is gonna be my third Job in the same company.

Today I ended a long term relationship, but I'm not bothered, it wasn't mine :D
Why do men die before their wives?? Cause they want to.
Why do #men pass gas more than #women? Cause women don't shut up long enough to build up the required pressure.
Why do women fake orgasms?? Cause they think men care
How do you make 5 pounds of fat look good?? Put a #nipple on it.
What's the difference between a battery and women?? A battery has a positive side
